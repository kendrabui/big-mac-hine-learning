The Challenge

For any fast-paced business, inventory management is a constant struggle between understocking (lost sales) and overstocking (wasted money). This project replaces slow, manual inventory counts with an autonomous AI system that manages your stock for you.

‚ú® Core Features

Autonomous Monitoring: Uses a live camera feed to identify and count inventory in real-time.

Strategic Decision-Making: Intelligently decides whether to re-order items or create a promotion for surplus stock.

Automated Purchase Orders: Generates PDF purchase orders and drafts supplier emails when stock is low.

Creative Promotion Generation: Designs a complete marketing campaign‚Äîincluding an AI-generated image‚Äîto sell excess inventory.

Natural Language Control: Allows managers to modify orders with simple text commands (e.g., "add our standard drinks").

ü§ù Meet the Agents

Our system's power comes from a team of specialized AI agents working together:

The Sentinel Agent (Observer): Uses Gemini Pro Vision to watch the camera feed and provide an accurate, real-time inventory count.

The Strategist Agent (Brain): Analyzes the inventory data and decides on the best course of action: re-order or promote.

The TaskMaster Agent (Operator): Executes the re-order plan by creating purchase orders and preparing communications.

The Maestro Agent (Creative): Solves overstocking by designing a promotional campaign, complete with a unique, AI-generated marketing image.
